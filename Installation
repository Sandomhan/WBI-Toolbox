###Simulink Library for Whole Body Control on Humanoid Robots

This document describes basic instructions on how to use this library, *tips and tricks* to do so and a walkthrough to get you started using it. Simulink blocks consist of S-functions (http://goo.gl/1GuHVd) which allow C/C++ user specific code compiled as Matlab Executable (MEX) files, thus extending the capabilities of the Simulink environment. In other words, MEX files have been created linking YARP, iCub and **iDynTree** (a more efficient and generic YARP-based robot dynamics library than its predecessor iDyn - http://goo.gl/BnGzKr) and wrapping the **Whole Body Interface** described in http://goo.gl/dBWO3k. Soft-Real Time is ensured by slowing down the simulation to respect a user specified rate. 

##Main goal
The library should allow non-programming experts or those researchers just getting acquainted with Whole Body Control to more easily deploy controllers either on simulation or the real platform, as well as to analyze their performance and take advantage of the innumerable MATLAB and Simulink toolboxes. We like to call it "rapid controller prototyping" after which a proper YARP module should be made for hard real time performance and final deployment.
